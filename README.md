# ShredOS Customer CSV Generator
Creates a new customer info CSV for ShredOS and writes it to USB sticks mounted at D: E: F: and G:

WARNING: WILL OVERWRITE ANY CSV THAT IS CURRENTLY ON A SHREDOS USB STICK

This tool will quickly batch write new customer info into ShredOS usb sticks.

It will not touch any drives that don't have ShredOS on them as it checks that the etc folder exists before copying.

You can batch write a new CSV file onto up to 4 USB drives saving time when you need new info regularly
